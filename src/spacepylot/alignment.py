        To keep track of any user given offsets, the applied offsets and

            Positive values translate the image in the opposite

        guess_rotation : float, optional

    """
    Finds the translational offset between the reference and prealign images
    using phase cross correlation. Phase cross correlation works by converting
    the images into fourier space. Here, translational offsets are represented
    as a phase difference, where there is no signal when they are out of phase,
    and a sharp peak when the image is in phase. This sharp peak is used
    to work out the offset between two images.

    to reproduce the vector changes between a set of xy coordinates.

    This can align an image given a minimum of 4 xy, grid points from the reference
    image and their location in the prealign image.

    Default homography is the skimage.transform.EuclideanTransform. This forces
    the solution to output only a rotation and a translation.
    Other homography matrices can be used to find image shear, and scale changed
    between th reference and prealign image.

    Homography works because the translation and rotation (and scale etc.) matrix
    can be combined into one operation. This matrix is called the homography
    matrix. We can then write out a set of equations
    describing the new yx, grid points as a function of the rotation and translation.
    By writing these equations for the new x and y for each grid point
    up as a matrix, we can just use singular value decomposition (SVD) to find the
    coefficients (ie the translation and rotation) and out.
    To improve this, we typically use least squares, with additional constraints
    that we now to help improve the output homography matrix.

    Most off the shell homography routines apply the rotation matrix first
    then apply the translation matrix. To reverse this ordering, set

        """If the solution is offset by more than ~5 pixels, optical flow struggles
        to match up the pixels. This method gets around this by applying optical
        flow multiple times to that the shifts and rotations converge to a solution.
        TODO = Make this stop after a change between solutions is smaller that
        a user defined value (i.e >1% for example)

        Parameters
        ----------
        nruns_opticalflow : int, optional
            The number of times to perform optical flow to find the shifts and
            rotation. The default is 1, as normally we should use iterations
            within optical flow itself, and not from this stage.
        num_per_dimension : int, optional
             For each axis, this sets the number of grid points to be calculated.
             The default is 50.
        homography_method : function, optional
            The (skimage) transformation method. Different transforms can find
            additional types of matrix transformations that might be present.
            For alignment, we only want to find rotation and transformation. For
            only these transformations, use the Euclidean transform. The default
            is transform.EuclideanTransform.
        reverse_order : bool, optional
            If the order that a user will use to  correct the alignment is NOT
            rotation, then translation, set this to True. The default is False.
        oflow_test: bool
            If set to True (default), will use set of parameters for optical flow
            which makes it fast (but not necessarily accurate).
        **kwargs: additional arguments
            Those arguments will be passed on to ransac in the homography
            calculation.
